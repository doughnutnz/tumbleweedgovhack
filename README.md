# Our Project: The Kiwi Playgrounds App

The app - which has a supporting web site and database backend - enables parents to quickly find playgrounds close to where they are or further afield on the basis of playground equipment, otherÂ key features and app user provided-ratings.

Parents want to ensure their children learn, have fun and meet new people. The many safe and well-equiped playgrounds in New Zealand provide a great venue for these things to happen.  The problem is that there are many playgrounds targeting different ages with various equipment sets and other features - and no *easy* way to find new playgrounds and decide whether it's worth giving them a try.

The **Kiwi Playgrounds App** makes this much easier, presenting publicly available parks and weather data in a graphical, interactive way.
