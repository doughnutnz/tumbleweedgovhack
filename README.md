# Our Project: The Kiwi Playgrounds App

The app - which has a supporting web site - enables parents to quickly find playgrounds close to where they are or further afield on the basis of playground equipment, otherÂ key features and app user provided-ratings.

Parents want to ensure that there children, learn, have fun and meet new people and the many safe and well-equiped playgrounds in New Zealand provide a great venue for these thigns to happen.  The problem is that there are many playgrounds targeting different ages with various equipment sets and otehr features - and no easy way to find new playgrounds and decide whetehr it's worth giving them a try or not.

This app makes it a lot easier, presenting publicly available government and other data in a graphical, interactive way.
